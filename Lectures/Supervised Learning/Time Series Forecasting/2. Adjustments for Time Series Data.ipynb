    "## Data split adjustments for time series\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal nature of time series data changes how we will approach data splits. When creating splits for time series you have to respect the sequence of observations, meaning that we cannot just randomly split the data as we have done up to this point. Random splits could result in us training a model on data points that have occurred after the points we are trying to predict, essentially using the future to predict the past, Great Scott!\n",

    "### Train test and validation splits\n",
    "\n",
    "In forecasting we typically have a set timeframe into the future that we would like to predict. The number of steps forward we want to be able to forecast, say $h$, is know as our forecast's <i>horizon</i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "In train test splits (or validation splits) for time series you set aside the last one, two or three horizon's worth of data for your test (or validation) set. To illustrate see this image with 12 observations.\n",
