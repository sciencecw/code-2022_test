    "\n",
    "In real world settings it is important to give careful consideration to which performance metric(s) are optimized in model selection. When selecting try to translate what the metric translates into when considering the real world problem you are considering.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, public health often focus on sensitivity and specificity because they can be translated into real world health impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of deadly disease for which we have successful regimens we may choose to go for tests that have high sensitivity. While we may opt for high specificity if the disease or condition in question does not tend to cause severe outcomes in the individual and the test or treatment is highly invasive or expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "A careful consideration of metrics can also contribute to your understanding of what the classifier is capable of, which should help you frame your findings in terms that stakeholders can better understand."
