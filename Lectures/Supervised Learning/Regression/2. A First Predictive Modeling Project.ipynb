    "In predictive modeling problems it is also smart to have a <i>baseline model</i>. A baseline model is a simple model that exists for comparison purposes. These are important because they allow us to put our model results into context. For example, we may end up with an MSE of $100$. Is that good? Is that bad? In the abstract it is impossible to tell. It is only when we have a reasonable baseline model that we are able to put into context how good our performance is. Again for example, if our baseline model's MSE was $1000$ our model with MSE$=100$ has done quite well, but if our baseline model's MSE was $10$ our model has underperformed the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, merely outperforming the baseline is not always an indication of the best model. We also need to consider things like training time, model complexity and interpretability. While those will not be considerations in this notebook, they will become more important as we progress through these notebooks and in your own data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem a standard first baseline is to predict the average value of the output, $\\overline{\\texttt{W}}$, for any value of the input. This brings us to three models:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Model 0: } \\ \\ \\texttt{W} = E\\left(\\texttt{W}\\right) + \\epsilon.\n",
    "$$\n",
