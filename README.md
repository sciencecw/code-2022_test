## Python Prep

This folder contains all of the python prep content for the boot camp. Those of you looking to get acquainted with python or just wanting a quick refresher should start here!

## Lectures

This folder contains the jupyter notebooks that correspond to the lecture videos. Note that not every notebook will be covered in our synchronous Zoom lectures, but every notebook will have at least one pre-recorded lecture video here, <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/boot-camp">https://www.erdosinstitute.org/boot-camp</a>.
